### Hi there 👋, My name is Samiul Hasan Siam
#### I am Full-Stack Web Developer

I’m a passionate and growth-focused Full-Stack Web Developer, primarily working with the MERN ecosystem. I enjoy transforming ideas into real applications, building everything from secure authentication systems to complete e-commerce platforms. I’m currently sharpening my expertise in JavaScript and TypeScript across both frontend and backend.

My work spans React (Vite), Next.js, Express.js, Node.js, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, Cloudinary, and JWT-based authentication. I’ve built role-based dashboards, user/admin systems, profile management with image uploads, and full CRUD features. I also use PostgreSQL with Prisma when projects call for relational structure.

Alongside development, I’m expanding into DevOps to better understand real-world deployment. I’m actively learning Docker, CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, and cloud deployment workflows to prepare myself for production-grade engineering.

I love learning deeply, solving problems, and pushing myself to grow. My long-term aim is to become a skilled software engineer and eventually build impactful products.

🔹 Current Focus: MERN stack mastery, TypeScript, DevOps fundamentals, deployment automation, and scalable architecture.
🔹 Strengths: Fast learning, analytical thinking, clean code mindset, and consistent improvement.

I’m always happy to connect with developers, mentors, and teams working on meaningful ideas.
